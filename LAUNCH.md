# Cairn — Launch Copy (v0.3)

**Title:** Cairn — compose essays from your highlights, notes, and quotes

I built this plugin because I kept hitting the same wall: I had hundreds of atomic notes and Readwise highlights, but no good way to assemble them into an actual essay inside Obsidian.

Longform is great for novels, but essays are different. You're pulling scattered ideas together, finding the argument, rearranging until it clicks. And the best insights often emerge *during* writing, not before it.

**Cairn** gives you the full loop — from highlights to finished essay:

1. **Distill highlights** — Select a quote in any file (Readwise imports work great), right-click → "Distill highlight to note." Write your idea in your own words. Cairn creates an atomic note with a Reference section linking back to the source.
2. **Pull in notes** — Fuzzy search your vault, add notes as essay sections.
3. **Browse & collect** — Keep the sidebar open while reading source notes. Right-click to add quotes directly to your essay with attribution.
4. **Rearrange** — Drag or use arrow buttons to build your argument.
5. **Write** — Hit "Open Essay" to jump back. Edit directly in the file. The sidebar reflects your structure live.
6. **Extract back** — When a new idea emerges while writing, extract it as a standalone note. The Zettelkasten loop completes.
7. **Export** — Copy to clipboard with wikilinks stripped, headings optionally removed, ready for publishing.

Your essay is a normal markdown file. No hidden markers, no compile step, no lock-in.

The workflow I didn't expect: **browsing with the sidebar open**. You navigate through source notes, reading highlights and ideas, adding quotes and distilled notes as you go. Then hit "Open Essay" to return and write the connective tissue. It feels like building a case — collecting evidence, then writing your argument.

Includes a **sample project** that walks through every feature if you want to try it hands-on.

I'm a journalist (small-town newspaper publisher), not a developer, so I'd love feedback from people who write from their notes. What's missing? What would make this fit your workflow better?

**Title:** I built Cairn — an essay composer that turns highlights into notes and notes into essays, all inside Obsidian

I kept seeing the same question: "How do I actually write from my notes?" The answers were always embeds (read-only), copy-paste (loses connection), or Longform (built for novels).

So I built Cairn. The full loop:

**Read → Highlight → Distill → Note → Essay**

- **Distill highlights** — Select a quote, right-click, write your idea in your own words. Creates an atomic note with source reference. Works great with Readwise imports.
- **Browse & collect** — Keep the sidebar open while reading. Right-click quotes to add them to your essay. Hit "Open Essay" to return and write.
- **Extract back** — Writing generates ideas. When a section crystallizes into its own concept, one click extracts it as a standalone note. Your vault grows from your writing.
- **Export clean** — Clipboard, wikilinks stripped, headings optional.

Your essay stays a plain markdown file. There's a sample project that walks you through every feature.

The workflow that surprised me: browsing source notes with the sidebar open, collecting quotes and distilled ideas as you go, then returning to write the connective tissue. It feels less like "writing" and more like building a case.

How do you handle the highlights-to-essay pipeline? Curious what others do.

## Reddit r/Zettelkasten

**Title:** Completing the loop: highlights → atomic notes → essays → new notes (Obsidian plugin)

Ahrens talks about how the Zettelkasten should make writing almost mechanical — you've already done the thinking in your notes, now you just assemble. But there's a gap before that: turning *highlights* into *your own ideas*. And a gap after: capturing the new ideas that emerge *during* composition.

I built an Obsidian plugin called Cairn that tries to close both gaps:

**Before writing:** Select a highlight, right-click → "Distill." Write the idea in your own words. Cairn creates an atomic note with the quote and source reference attached. This is the thinking step that turns someone else's words into your knowledge.

**During writing:** Pull notes into an essay, rearrange sections, write transitions. When new ideas emerge, extract them back into your vault as standalone notes.

**The browsing workflow:** Keep the sidebar open while navigating source notes. Add quotes directly to your essay. Distill highlights into new notes. Then return to write. It mirrors how Ahrens describes working with a slip-box — you're in conversation with your notes.

The distill step is what I haven't seen elsewhere. Most tools skip straight from "capture" to "write." But the thinking happens in between — when you put someone else's highlight into your own words. That's the moment the idea becomes yours.

Curious how others handle this phase.

## Blog/Newsletter Pitch (for PKM bloggers)

**Subject:** Cairn v0.3 — the highlights-to-essay pipeline for Obsidian

Hi [Name],

I built an Obsidian plugin that I think your readers would find useful — Cairn handles the full pipeline from highlights to finished essays.

Most writing tools assume you're creating from scratch. But PKM writers have already done the reading — they need tools for the messy middle: turning highlights into ideas, assembling ideas into arguments, and capturing the new insights that emerge during writing.

Cairn adds three things I haven't seen elsewhere:

1. **Distill** — Select a highlight, write your idea in your own words, get an atomic note with the source reference. This is the thinking step most tools skip.
2. **Browse & collect** — Keep the sidebar open while reading source notes. Right-click to add quotes or distill highlights. Return to write when ready.
3. **Extract back** — When new ideas emerge during writing, one click makes them standalone vault notes.

It's free, open source, and includes a sample project that walks through every feature. Your essay stays a normal markdown file — no lock-in.

Happy to provide screenshots, a demo, or answer questions.

Best,

**Short version:**
Built an Obsidian plugin for the full highlights-to-essay loop. Distill quotes into atomic notes. Browse & collect with the sidebar open. Write your argument. Extract new ideas back out. https://github.com/MaggieMcgu/obsidian-note-assembler

**Thread version:**
1/ The gap in most PKM tools: you capture highlights, you have notes, but the step from "collected ideas" to "finished essay" is... just stare at a blank page?

2/ I built Cairn for Obsidian. It handles the full loop: Highlight → Distill (write the idea in your own words) → Collect → Arrange → Write → Extract new ideas back out.

3/ The workflow I didn't expect: browsing source notes with the sidebar open. Add quotes, distill highlights, collect pieces — then hit "Open Essay" and write the connective tissue. It feels like building a case.

4/ The distill step is the key. Most tools skip from "capture" to "write." But the thinking happens when you put someone else's highlight into your own words. That's the moment the idea becomes yours.

5/ Free, open source, includes a sample project to try it hands-on. Your essay is a normal markdown file — no lock-in.
