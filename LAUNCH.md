**Title:** Note Assembler — turn your Zettelkasten into essays

I built this plugin because I kept hitting the same wall: I had hundreds of atomic notes but no good way to assemble them into an actual essay inside Obsidian.

Longform is great for novels, but essays are different. You're not writing scenes in order — you're pulling scattered ideas together, finding the argument, rearranging until it clicks. And sometimes the best ideas emerge *during* the writing, not before it.

**Note Assembler** gives you a sidebar to:

- **Pull in notes** — fuzzy search your vault, add them as sections
- **Rearrange** — drag or use arrow buttons to build your argument
- **Extract back** — when a new idea emerges while writing, pull it out as a standalone note with one click
- **Follow the trail** — a "Related Notes" panel surfaces wikilinked notes you haven't added yet
- **Export clean** — copy to clipboard with wikilinks stripped, ready for publishing

Your essay is a normal markdown file. No hidden markers, no compile step, no lock-in. The sidebar just reads your `## ` headings and gives you tools to work with them.

The key feature that I haven't seen elsewhere: **extract-back**. You're writing about water conservation and three paragraphs crystallize into their own idea about snowpack cycles. Click the arrow, pick a folder, and it becomes a standalone note in your vault. Your essay keeps its text. The Zettelkasten loop completes.

I'm a journalist (small-town newspaper publisher), not a developer, so I'd love feedback from people who write from their notes. What's missing? What would make this fit your workflow better?

**Title:** I built a plugin for turning Zettelkasten notes into essays — and extracting new ideas back out

I kept seeing the same question on forums: "How do I actually write from my notes?" The answers were always embeds (read-only), copy-paste (loses connection), or Longform (built for novels, not essays).

So I built Note Assembler. Sidebar panel, pull in notes, rearrange, write, extract new ideas back to your vault. Your essay stays a plain markdown file.

The feature I'm most excited about: **extract-back**. Writing generates new ideas. When a section crystallizes into its own concept, one click extracts it as a standalone note. The vault grows from your writing, not just into it.

Would love to hear how others handle the notes-to-essay workflow. What's your process?

**Title:** Completing the loop: a tool for writing essays from atomic notes (and extracting ideas back)

Ahrens talks about how the Zettelkasten should make writing almost mechanical — you've already done the thinking in your notes, now you just assemble and connect. But the "assemble" step is where most tools fall apart.

I built an Obsidian plugin called Note Assembler that tries to close this gap. Pull notes into an essay outline, rearrange sections, write transitions, and — crucially — extract new ideas back into your vault as standalone notes when they emerge during writing.

That last part is what I haven't seen elsewhere. The best Zettelkasten insights often come *during* composition, not before it. Extract-back lets you capture them without leaving your essay.

Curious how others handle this phase of the workflow. Do you write inside your note system or export to somewhere else?

## Blog/Newsletter Pitch (for PKM bloggers)

**Subject:** New Obsidian plugin: Note Assembler — the missing Zettelkasten-to-essay tool

Hi [Name],

I built an Obsidian plugin that I think your readers would find useful — Note Assembler bridges the gap between atomic notes and finished essays.

The core insight: most writing tools assume you're creating from scratch. But Zettelkasten writers have already done the thinking — they need assembly tools, not blank pages. Note Assembler gives you a sidebar to pull notes in, rearrange your argument, and export clean text.

The feature that makes it different: **extract-back**. When new ideas emerge during writing (and they always do), one click extracts a section back into a standalone vault note. The essay keeps its text. Your Zettelkasten grows from your writing.

It's free, open source, and works as a normal Obsidian community plugin.

Happy to answer questions or provide screenshots/a demo if you'd like to cover it.

Best,
Maggie McGuire

**Short version:**
Built an Obsidian plugin for turning Zettelkasten notes into essays. Pull in notes, rearrange, write — then extract new ideas back out as standalone notes. The thinking loop, completed. https://github.com/MaggieMcgu/obsidian-note-assembler

**Thread version:**
1/ I kept hitting the same wall: hundreds of atomic notes, no good way to turn them into an essay inside Obsidian.

2/ Longform is great for novels. Embeds are read-only. Copy-paste loses the connection. So I built Note Assembler.

3/ The key feature: extract-back. Writing generates ideas. When a section crystallizes into its own concept, one click makes it a standalone note. Your Zettelkasten grows FROM your writing.

4/ It's free, open source, and your essay stays a normal markdown file. No lock-in.
